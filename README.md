E-Commerce Website 

Purpose of this project was to develop a dynamic website that could function as a electronics store as a prototype for future websites. 

The front end of the website uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
The backend uses Python's Flask framework. Data is stored internally with a SQLite3 database as this is just a mock website. Other libraries used are WTForms for data validation and Jinja2 for HTML templating.
